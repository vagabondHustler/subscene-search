To  streamline the process, please follow the guidelines below.

#### Suggesting a Feature:

- Check the code on GitHub to ensure that the feature isn't already available.
- Consider whether the feature is necessary in the library or could be explained in a separate example.
- Check existing issues, both open and closed, to avoid suggesting a feature that has already been suggested.

#### Filing a Bug Report:

- Provide a detailed description of the bug.
- List the steps you've taken so far and any solutions you've tried.

Submitting a Pull Request:

- Ensure that your code style is consistent with ours (we follow the black style guidelines for Python).
- Include comments where necessary and a clear description of what your example is expected to do.
- Submit only one or two examples/feature per pull-request.
- Do not include any license information in your examples; our repositories are MIT licensed.
- Do not submit multiple variations of the same example; demonstrate one thing concisely.

#### Licensing:

- By submitting code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably agree to adopt the associated licenses.
- You can find licensing information in the LICENSE file.

#### Submitting your Code:

- Be receptive to feedback and be prepared for rejection; we can't always accept contributions.
- Submit your contribution as a Pull Request.

Thank you for taking the time to read and follow these guidelines.
