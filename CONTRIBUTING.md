## Suggesting a feature

If you've got a good idea for a feature, then please let me know!

Feature suggestions are embraced, but will often be filed for a rainy day. If you require a feature urgently it's best to write it yourself.

When suggesting a feature, make sure to:

* Check the code on GitHub to make sure it's not already hiding in an unreleased version ;)
* Considered if it's necessary in the library, or is an advanced technique that could be separately explained in an example
* Check existing issues, open and closed, to make sure it hasn't already been suggested

## Filing a bug report

If all else fails then please raise an Issue to let us know. Be as detailed as possible, and be ready to answer questions when I get back to you. Make sure you:

* List the steps you've taken so far,
* and any solutions you've tried

## Submitting a pull request

If you've decided to fix a bug, even something as small as a single-letter typo then great! Anything that improves the code/documentation for all future users is warmly welcomed.

When contributing a new example or making a change to a library please keep your code style consistent with ours. I try to stick to the [black guidelines](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html) for Python.

#### Do

* Do use black style guidelines
* Do comment your code where necessary
* Do submit only a single example/feature per pull-request
* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do

#### Don't

* Don't include any license information in your examples- our repositories are MIT licensed
* Don't try to do too much at once- submit one or two examples at a time, and be receptive to feedback
* Don't submit multiple variations of the same example, demonstrate one thing concisely

### Licensing

When you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably agree to adopt the associated licenses. You should be able to find this in the file named `LICENSE`.

You can learn more about the MIT license at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

### Submitting your code

Once you're ready to share your contribution with us you should submit it as a Pull Request.

* Be ready to receive and embrace constructive feedback.
* Be prepared for rejection; I can't always accept contributions. If you're unsure, ask first!

## Thank you!

If you have any questions, concerns or comments about these guidelines, please get in touch with me, easiest would be at twitter [@vagabondHustl3r](https://twitter.com/vagabondHustl3r).

Above all else, I hope you enjoy yourself, learn things and make and share great contributions because I need learning too.
