## About <a name = "about"></a>

- Automatically search, download and extract subtitles for any movie or show with one easy mouse click from the context menu.
- Has a GUI for all the custom settings that can be configured.
- For 70 different languages, of which most work on all available subtitle sites.
- Can be configured to include hearing impaired subtitles only, none-hearing impaired subtitles only or both.
- Configure how strictly the file name has to match the search results.
- Can be ran from a compiled executable, without the need for a Python interpreter and importing modules.
- Subtitles are gathered from subscene and opensubtitles.
- Pick where you get the subtitles from.
- Works inside and outside of a env.

This started as a fun project to learn how to code in python and how to use git, has now developed into a application I use daily and enjoy working on. There are many similar repositories out there that grab subtitles automatically from the web, so this might not be the most unique project. But feel free to check this one out, might offer something new. Have tried to make the setup processes as painless as possible with the use of as few external modules as possible. The average run time is around 1 second, a little bit longer for TV-Series due to the high amount of titles.

Feel free to ask me anything about this project, request new features, contribute or give constructive feedback.

FYI:
If it takes a long time for anything to happen, it's most likely because subscene is under heavy load and all connections takes longer than usual. Nothing I can do about that. But you can disabled them as a provider in the GUI.
